Buzzstream makes the messy job of email outreach and link building streamlined and organized. Make sure to check out their new prospecting and email-finding features. Official Website: http://buzzstream.com Check My Links Link BuildingFree If you do Broken Link Building (or The Moving Man Method), then you'll love Check My Links. With a click of a button, this Chrome extension quickly checks any webpage for broken links. Official Website: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/check-my-links/ojkcdipcgfaekbeaelaapakgnjflfglf?hl=en-GB Citation Labs' Broken Link Finder Link BuildingPaid Instead of hunting for broken links page-by-page, The Broken Link Finder proactively searches the web for them. Just search for a keyword and the tool will scour the internet for broken links...and hand them to you on a silver platter. Cool feature: You can sort your results by how many people link to the broken link.

Official Website: http://linkprospector.citationlabs.com/ Content Marketer Link BuildingPaidBrian's Favorite An excellent tool that finds contact information (ie. emails) and helps you reach out to those people. I've found that the contact info it spits out is pretty darn accurate. Cool Feature: Content Marketer provides email templates you can use for outreach. They have templates for guest post requests, LinkedIn outreach and more. Official Website: https://contentmarketer.io/ Domain Hunter Plus Link BuildingFree Domain Hunter Plus is similar to Check My Links. But this tool also checks to see if the broken link's domain is available for registration. Cool feature in theory...but I rarely find any free domain names with this tool. That's because authoritative domains tend to get scooped up pretty quickly. Still a helpful tool for broken link building or The Moving Man Method though. Official Website: http://netvantagemarketing.com/about/domain-hunter-plus Free Broken Link Checker Link BuildingFreemium This tool checks a website for broken links. Helpful for broken link building. Official Website: http://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/ GroupHigh Link BuildingPaid GroupHigh is advanced blogger outreach software. Despite the laundry list of features, it's pretty darn easy to use. Just enter a few keywords to find blogs in your industry. Then filter by Domain Authority and last post date to whittle down the list to bloggers that are worth reaching out to. You can also reach out to them (and track your results) within the platform. Official Website: http://www.grouphigh.com/ HARO (Help a Reporter Out) Link BuildingFreemiumBrian's Favorite Want to get backlinks from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal? You can hire a pricey PR firm...or you can use HARO. HARO is a "dating service" that connects journaists with sources.

Like many tools, LinkMiner check for broken links on a page. But this free Chrome extension also shows you how many links the broken link has pointing to it. Uber helpful for broken link building. Cool Feature: LinkMiner shows you how many outbound links a page has...on a Google SERP. That way you can zero-in on pages with lots of outbound links (and therefore, broken link building opportunities). Official Website: http://pointblankseo.com/linkminer Linkody Link Building, Backlink AnalysisPaid Linkody lets you know you when you get (or lose) a backlink. It also provides info on your new backlinks (like Mozrank and anchor text). Cool Feature: Linkody emails you when a competitor gets a new backlink.

Official Website: http://www.linkstant.com/ Muck Rack Link BuildingPaidBrian's Favorite If you want to get mentions (and backlinks) from sites like The New York Times and Forbes, you need to start rubbing elbows with journalists. And Muck Rack is an impressive PR tool that helps you quickly find journalists that cover your site's industry. Cool Feature: The "Journalist Directory" is a hand-curated list of journalists at over 500 media outlets. Includes their latest tweets, columns and up-to-date contact information.

Official Website: https://www.rmoov.com/index.php ScrapeBox Link Building, Keyword Research, Backlink AnalysisPaid ScrapeBox is the self-proclaimed "Swiss army knife of SEO".

Official Website: https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/ Bing Webmaster Tools Technical SEO, Keyword ResearchFree As you might expect from Bing, Bing Webmaster Tools is good...but not nearly as good as Google Search Console.

Cool Feature: Go to "Acquisition" --"Search Engine Optimization"-- Landing Pages. This will bring up the pages on your site that get the most impressions and clicks from Google. Look at the CTR field to see your pages that get the best click-through-rate. Finally, apply elements from those title and description tags to pages that get a bad CTR. And watch your organic traffic move on up Official Website: http://www.google.com/analytics/ Google Analytics Referrer Spam Killer Technical SEOFree When you link your Google Analytics to this free spam killer tool, it will add filters to your account that remove over 100 know spammy referrer websites from your list of referring domains. That way your GA data will be squeaky clean. Official Website: https://www.adwordsrobot.com/en/tools/ga-referrer-spam-killer Google Mobile-Friendly Test Technical SEOFree Google recently started to downrank sites that aren't mobile friendly. But how do you know if a page on your site is up to snuff? Just enter the URL into the Google Mobile-Friendly Test Tool...and you'll get a simple "yes/no" answer from Big G. Official Website: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/ Google PageSpeed Insights Technical SEOFree You know Google uses your site's loading speed as a ranking factor. Well Google PageSpeed insights tells you whether or not Google sees your site as lightning-fast or snail-slow. It also hands you actionable suggestions that you can use to speed things up.   Official Website: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ Google Search Console Technical SEO, Rank TrackingFreeBrian's Favorite Google Search Console is a suite of helpful tools straight from Google.

Cool feature: Go to "Search Traffic"---"Search Analytics" to get a list of keywords that you currently rank for. Sort by "Position" so that your \#1 rankings are at the top. Then scroll down until you find where you rank \#10-\#25 in Google's search results. These are pages that you can sometimes push to page 1 with some extra SEO love (for example, pointing a few internal links to that page). Official Website: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en Google XML Sitemaps Technical SEOFreemium A WordPress plugin that creates an SEO-friendly sitemap of your site automatically. However, if you already use the Yoast SEO Plugin, you don't need this as Yoast does the same exact thing. Official Website: https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/ GTmetrix Technical SEOFree Google Page Speed Insights checks your site's code. GTmetrix actually loads your site. When I want to judge my site's real loading speed, I always defer to GTmetrix. It also gives you recommendations for getting your site up to speed (literally).

The outstanding Panguin Tool will help you get to the bottom of it. Just link up Panguin with your Google Analytics and the tool will show if your organic traffic dip happened at the same time as a major Google update. Official Website: http://www.barracuda-digital.co.uk/panguin-tool/ Plugin SEO Technical SEO, Content OptimizationFree A fast and free on-page SEO analysis tool.

Official Website: https://www.pluginseo.com/ Raven Tools Technical SEO, Content OptimizationPaid A pro-level tools suite designed for digital marketing agencies. Raven Tools probably has the best site auditor tool I've ever used. And unlike most site audit tools, Raven shows you EXACTLY what you need to do to fix any SEO issues that your site has. Cool Feature: "Thin content" reveals content that might put you at risk for a Google Panda penalty. Official Website: http://raventools.com/ Referral Ghost Spam Removal Tool Technical SEOFree Is referral "ghost spam" messing up your Google Analytics data? Well this free tool quickly filters out spam bots by creating a segment in GA that ignores traffic from spammy websites. Official Website: https://loganix.net/rst-lander/ Rel Nofollow Checkbox Technical SEOFree This WordPress plugin lets you easily set links on your site as "nofollow". Official Website: https://wordpress.org/plugins/rel-nofollow-checkbox/ Screaming Frog SEO Spider Technical SEOFreemium Screaming Frog is the first technical SEO tool that I ever used. And it still holds up today. Great for quickly identifying technical issues that's holding your site back from the first page. Free version works well. But to get really down-and-dirty, you definitely want to splurge for the full paid version. Official Website: http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/ SEO & Website Analysis (WooRank) Technical SEO, Content OptimizationFreeBrian's Favorite This free Chrome extension gives you important SEO info from within your browser. Just click a button and the SEO & Website Analysis by WooRank analyzes your page's basic SEO metrics (like title tags that are too long). But the tool also hooks you up with other helpful info (like whether your site is mobile optimized and how fast it loads). Yes, you can use this extension for your own site. But in experience this tool is even better for competitor analysis because it shows you the site's Facebook and Twitter pages, what technology they're using on their site, and traffic estimates...all from within your browser. Official Website: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seo-website-analysis/hlngmmdolgbdnnimbmblfhhndibdipaf?hl=en SEO Friendly Images Technical SEOFreemium Have a bunch of images on your site that are missing alt text and titles? Well you COULD add that info one-by-one...or you could use this helpful plugin. SEO Friendly Images WordPress grabs the file name of your image and turns it into the image's alt text and title. For example, let's say you have an image called "redsox.jpeg". SEO Friendly Images will automatically turn that file name into "red sox" for image's alt text and title. Official Website: http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/wordpress-plugins/seo-friendly-images/ SEO Monitor Technical SEO, Rank TrackingPaidBrian's Favorite SEO Monitor is a one-stop dashboard for your SEO performance.

Just head over to this tool to see how volatile Google has been over the last 30 days. Official Website: http://serpmetrics.com/flux/ Site Analyzer Technical SEO, Content OptimizationPaid Site Analyzer a high-quality site audit tool. Yes, $10 for a 100 page scan is a little steep. But the tool hooks you up with a lot of helpful information, especially when it comes to optimizing your content for better on-page SEO. Official Website: https://www.site-analyzer.com/ Site Condor Technical SEOPaid A VERY in-depth site audit tool. If there's a potential SEO issue with your site (like a broken link or a title tag that's too long), Site Condor will identify it. Even I was a bit overwhelmed with the issues it found at first. Fortunately, the tool comes packed with a "View Recommendations" button that tells you how to fix any problems that it finds. Cool Feature: "Site Graph" visualizes your site's link structure.

Similar to Screaming Frog but with a few extra features (like graphs and the ability to filter results). Official Website: https://www.eebew.com/spider/ Website Penalty Indicator Technical SEOFreeBrian's Favorite Wondering whether or not you got slapped by a Google Penalty? Well Website Penalty Indicator can give you some much-needed insight. The tool lines up your organic traffic with dates of Google penalties...like "Mobilegeddon" and the Phantom update.

Official Website: http://www.whitespark.ca/ Woorank Technical SEO, Content OptimizationPaid Top-notch website analysis tool that tells you everything you need to know about your website's SEO health. Official Website: https://www.woorank.com/ Yoast SEO Plugin Technical SEO, Content OptimizationFreemiumBrian's Favorite Yoast is the \#1 SEO WordPress plugin for one simple reason: it works. It's also the SEO plugin that we use here at Backlinko. Cool Feature: "Bulk Editor" lets you edit dozens of pages with a click. Uber helpful if you ever have duplicate content issues on your site. Official Website: https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/ Zadroweb SEO Auditor (Just Added) Technical SEO, Content OptimizationFree A free SEO auditor that provides a high-level SEO overview of your site. Official Website: https://zadroweb.com/seo-auditor/ KEYWORD RESEARCH TOOLS AdWord & SEO Keyword Permutation Generator Keyword ResearchFree If you're looking for a way to discover new keywords, try mashing a bunch of words together and see what happens. (I'm not kidding) Creating keyword permutations is a classic Adwords tactic that few people in SEO use. And the Dan Zambonini permutation tool is one of the best keyword combo tools that I've tried. Official Website: http://seo.danzambonini.com/\# Answer The Public Keyword ResearchFree Answer The Public combines Google Autosuggest scraping with a question scraper. So if you want to know what questions your target audience types into Google, just pop the keyword into Answer The Public and you'll get a hefty list.   Official Website: http://answerthepublic.com/ FAQfox (Just Added) Keyword ResearchFree FAQfox is a question scraper tool. I like how you can choose the websites that FAQfox scrapes. So if there's a particular site that your target audience hands out on (for example, Reddit) you can ask the tool to only search that site. Official Website: http://faqfox.com/ FreshKey Keyword ResearchPaid FreshKey is one of the better keyword research tools I tried for this list (and I tried a TON of them). The tool generates sackfuls of keyword ideas by scraping Amazon, Bing, Ebay, Google Market and more. While most tools require a monthly subscription, FreshKey is a very reasonable one-time fee of 49 bucks. Official Website: http://freshkey.com/ Google Correlate Keyword ResearchFree An underrated keyword research tool that comes straight from Google. Google Correlate is really simple: It shows you keywords that tend to get searched for together. For example, let's say you pop "gluten free" into the tool. Google Correlate tells you that people searching for "gluten free" also search for "cheese gluten free" and "flour gluten free". Very cool. Official Website: http://www.google.com/trends/correlate Google Keyword Planner Keyword ResearchFreeBrian's Favorite The Google Keyword Planner is the only keyword tool that gives you data straight from the horse's mouth. Cool feature: The GKP tells you how likely someone searching for that keyword will buy something from you. How? Look at the "competition" and "estimated bid" columns. If the "competition" and "estimated bid" are high, you probably have a keyword that converts well. I put more weight on this than straight-up search volume. After all, who wants a bunch of tire kickers coming to their site? Official Website: https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner Google Trends Keyword ResearchFree I ALWAYS check Google Trends before pulling the trigger on a keyword. Why? Because I want to know whether or not my keyword is getting more (or less) popular. If you skip this step you risk optimizing your page around a dying keyword. Cool Feature: Scroll down to the bottom of the page and check out "Queries". These are related keywords that you can pop into the GKP to see if they're a good fit. Official Website: https://www.google.com/trends/ GrepWords Keyword ResearchPaid A solid, reasonably priced keyword research tool with an excellent question scraper. Cool Feature: "Divergent" shows you what time of the year certain keywords tend to spike. For example, if you want to see which gift card keywords tend to perk up around Christmas, GrepWords will show it to you. Ditto with Halloween and keywords related to "costumes". Official Website: http://grepwords.com/ HitTail Keyword ResearchPaid HitTail does two things very well: 1\. It shows you which keywords tend to bring in the most traffic for you (this helps get around the "not provided" problem. 2\. Shows you keyword suggestions. I was impressed by their keyword suggestions because they showed me keywords that I didn't see other tools. Official Website: https://www.hittail.com/ Imforsmb.com's Bulk Keyword Generator (Just Added) Keyword ResearchFree If you do SEO work for local clients (like plumbers and electricians), this tool can help you find local keywords that potential customers search for. For example, if you tell the tool that your client is a plumber in Boston, it will hand you 40-ish keywords that customers might use in Google. Official Website: http://www.imforsmb.com/tools/bulk-keyword-generator/ Jaaxy (Just Added) Keyword ResearchFreemium Jaaxy is an easy-to-use keyword research tool that specializes in spitting out lots of closely-related keywords. Nice tool. Official Website: http://www.jaaxy.com/ Keyword Combiner Keyword ResearchFree Yes, Keyword Combiner is designed for Adwords. But it's a great tool to find keywords that you can use for SEO as well. Just pop in a bunch of different keywords and the tool will mash them all together. Then upload them to the GKP to check their search volume. Helpful. Official Website: http://web.forret.com/tools/adwords.asp Keyword Eye Keyword ResearchFreemium A unique keyword research tool that shows you keyword suggestions as a word cloud. Bigger keywords=more search volume. It also color codes keywords based on Adwords competition (which is a good sign of a keyword's profitability). Official Website: http://www.keywordeye.com/ Keyword Revealer Keyword ResearchFreemium Keyword Revealer is a standard keyword research tool with a  a cool "Keyword Tree" feature. The keyword treee shows you keyword ideas as a tree. And when you click on a "branch" in the tree, a new set of branches appears. Helpful. Official Website: http://www.keywordrevealer.com/ Keyword Snatcher Keyword ResearchPaid This tool probably gives you more keyword ideas than any other tool on the market. Why? Because it finds keywords from a bunch of different places, like Ebay, Amazon and even Yahoo. In fact, the last seed keyword I put into it ("paleo diet") generated 15,000 keywords! The one downside to this tool is that it doesn't show you how many people search for the keywords that it spits out. So you need to manually upload the keyword list into the GKP to get search volume info. Official Website: http://keywordsnatcher.com/ Keyword Tool Dominator Keyword ResearchPaid A keyword tool that scrapes autocomplete suggestions from sites like Google, YouTube, Amazon, Bing and Etsy. Official Website: http://www.keywordtooldominator.com KeywordSpy Keyword ResearchFreemium A decent keyword research tool. While Keyword Spy is a bit dated (the copy still says "track your rankings in MSN"), it still works OK. The tool works just like SEMRush: enter a domain name into the tool and it will show you a list of keywords that the site ranks for. However, SEMRush is far and away the superior tool. Official Website: http://www.keywordspy.com/ KeywordTool.io Keyword ResearchFreemium An excellent keyword research tool that scrapes Google Autocomplete results. Although Google said they would be "restricting" access to Autocomplete, KeywordTool.io seems to have found a way around it. I just tested the tool and it brought back a bunch of excellent keyword suggestions just like it always does. Official Website: http://keywordtool.io/ kwfinder.com Keyword ResearchFreemium An insanely easy to use alternative to the Google Keyword Planner. Just pop a keyword into it and you get search volume, estimated bid and first page competition data within seconds. Official Website: https://kwfinder.com/ Long Tail Pro Keyword ResearchPaid A very easy-to-use keyword research tool. Enter a keyword and get suggestions. Simple and effective. Cool feature: Only want to see keywords that have a search volume between 1500-2100? How about keywords with an estimated bid of at least $2.50? Long Tail Pro's filtering feature makes it easy to see ONLY keywords that you actually want. Official Website: http://www.longtailpro.com/ Power Suggest Pro (Just Added) Keyword ResearchPaid Power Suggest Pro is a desktop-based keyword research tool. Enter a keyword and it spits out ideas from a number of different search engines (like Google and Wikipedia). Cool Feature: "Ideas!" give you a list of common terms people use in search engines (like "best X" and "how to fix Y"). Helpful for coming up with new keyword ideas. Official Website: http://www.powersuggestpro.com/ SECockpit Keyword ResearchPaidBrian's Favorite SECockpit is probably most advanced keyword research tool on the market. Yes, you enter a seed keyword and get suggestions like any other tool. But SECockpit can do so much more than list out a list of related keywords. It can spit out low competition keywords. It can show you keywords that get a minimum CPC in Adwords. It can even show you keywords that have YouTube, Ebay or Amazon results on the first page. Cool Feature: SECockpit scrapes the "Searches similar to..." from the bottom of Google's search results. This can often unearth keywords that you'd otherwise miss.
